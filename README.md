This is a short project to utlize web-scraping data, numpy and pandas
libraries as the primary methods to gather data on
local gas prices and compare gas prices to up-to-date
electricity rates within the state to identify
the energy difference and savings between an Electric Vehicle and an
Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle.
